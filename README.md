# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, LIZARD, SPOCK

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock is a student-made website that lets you pass time and have some carefree fun playing the modern version of the good ol' classic Rock, Paper, Scissors. It's designed for single play only and declares a winner once one side gets 5 wins. The user is faced with 5 choices, while the computer's choice is random. At any point, the player can reset the score and start over.
